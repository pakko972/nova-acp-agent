// chat-session.mjs — embedded chat server for the nova-acp-agent extension.
//
// Loaded by ws-server.js when acpagent.chat.enabled is on. Spawns an HTTP
// server (fixed port, configurable) that serves the chat UI assets in
// ./chat-ui/ and exposes a WebSocket /ws endpoint. Drives the configured AI
// backend (Anthropic SDK, OpenCode CLI, or Codex CLI) via a pluggable backend
// interface whose events are normalised to a common wire format before being
// forwarded to the chat UI WebSocket client.
//
// Lifecycle :
//   1. ws-server.js calls init({ port, apiKey, backend, agentPath, callNovaTool, log })
//   2. init starts the HTTP+WS server, returns a stop() function
//   3. ws-server.js calls stop() on shutdown
//
// The chat server is INDEPENDENT of the MCP server — they share the Nova
// round-trip plumbing (callNovaTool), but run on different ports and serve
// different clients.
